o1 : The 23rd International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2022) will be held in Bangalore, India, from December 4th to 8th, 2022.
o2 : The annual conference of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) is the world’s leading research forum on processing, analyzing, searching, organizing and accessing music-related data. The 23rd ISMIR conference welcomes contributions related to any aspect of music information research, including foundations and theories for music processing, analysis, algorithms, evaluation, and applications.
o3 : ISMIR is a truly interdisciplinary research community, involving researchers, developers, educators, librarians, students, and professionals from various disciplines such as computer science, electrical engineering, musicology, cognitive science, and library and information sciences. The ISMIR conference provides a venue for the exchange of ideas, issues, results, and perspectives among different profiles of people working with music and computing in a broad sense.
o4 : In addition to established research topics and tasks, ISMIR always welcomes brave new ideas and challenges. Submissions of novel music-related topics, tasks, and applications are highly encouraged to broaden the scope of ISMIR. ISMIR also has a tradition of publishing open datasets and open-source projects to enhance the scientific reproducibility, though ISMIR accepts submissions using proprietary datasets and implementations that are not sharable. ISMIR thus respects the diversity of academic disciplines, backgrounds, and approaches.
o5 : The accepted papers will be presented at the conference in a format to be decided.
cultu : The research carried out in MIR nowadays does not reflect the rich variety of the world’s music traditions. MIR studies are mostly focused on international mainstream popular music, Western art music and other styles mainly based on tonal principles and global consumption practices. From ISMIR we want to promote the study of still under-represented music traditions in MIR. These traditions might not only present music characteristics that would require novel approaches even for standard MIR tasks, but can represent under-studied musical functions and communities. In this regard, we also encourage the study of new groups of music makers and users, as well as the development of tools that benefit beyond mainstream music communities. Equally, we encourage studies from a cross-cultural perspective that cater to this musical and cultural diversity. To submit to this track, authors should indicate this in the main submission form. These submissions will follow the same submission process and requirements described below, but dedicated meta-reviewers will be selected to oversee their review. An award will be given to the best paper accepted within this special call.
selpro1 : Full paper review
selproa1 : Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers and a program committee member (meta-reviewer) who will overview the process and write a meta-review with a recommendation. The Scientific Program Chairs will make the final decision based on that recommendation.
selpro2 : Double blind review
selproa2 : ISMIR follows a double-blind review process. Authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the name(s) of the author(s).
selpro3 : Evaluation criteria
selproa3 : Evaluation criteria include the novelty of the paper, scholarly/scientific quality, reusable insights, pioneering proposals, appropriateness of topic, potential impact, readability and paper organization. Papers which propose brave new ideas are valued. It is helpful to read the reviewer guidelines at https://ismir.net/reviewer-guidelines before the paper submission.
